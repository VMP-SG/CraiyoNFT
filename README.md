# CraiyoNFT Documentation

CraiyoNFT was a project inspired by Craiyon. As a bunch of individuals interested in both Defi and Machine Learning, we decided to incorporate both of these elements together, and hence the CraiyoNFT marketplace was born. We are in no way affiliated with the creators of Craiyon.

## CraiyoNFT Webapp

The CraiyoNFT webapp is built using React. Simply install Node.js and node package dependencies to begin.

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

The webapp will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default
