# CraiyoNFT Documentation

CraiyoNFT was a project inspired by Craiyon. As a bunch of individuals interested in both Defi and Machine Learning, we decided to incorporate both of these elements together, and hence the CraiyoNFT marketplace was born. We are in no way affiliated with the creators of Craiyon.
